## How to play

- There are 2 types of zombies: **regular** and **shooter**.
    - Regular will try to kill you with bare hands
    - Shooter is more clever and will use a gun
- If you kill a zombie, it will spawn again in some time. *Note: every zombie has it's own speed.*
- You can use a **handgun**, **knife** and **rifle** to kill zombies.
- At the beginning you will have a rifle in your hands.
- There are some items spread across the map (bullets, rifles and handguns with some bullets already loaded, first aid kits and armor). You can pick up them by pressing **F** when you are staying within area of the item (circle). Then if there is enough space in the inventory item will be added to the inventory. Items will respawn again after certain amount of zombies killed.
- To open inventory you either:
    - press **E**
    - click on **+** with mouse **RIGHT BUTTON** on the right-top of the screen of the game
- You can select item from inventory and put it into tray by clicking on item with mouse **RIGHT BUTTON**, you have to have a slot selected before (select by pressing numbers 1-4).
- To drop an item you need to click on it with mouse **RIGHT BUTTON** and **LEFT-CONTROL** pressed at the same time.
- When you HP is 0 you is dead and you will be directed to the screen with killed zombie score and options: play again, go to the main menu or quit game, as in the pause screen.
